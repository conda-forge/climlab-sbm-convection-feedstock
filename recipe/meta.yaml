  summary: 'Standalone Python wrapper for the Simplified Betts-Miller moist convection model'
  description: |
    climlab-sbm-convection makes the Frierson Simplified Betts-Miller convection code callable from Python by wrapping using f2py. This is a lightweight wrapper that emulates the Fortran interface as closely as possible. The primary use case is to drive the convection process in climlab, but it can be used as a standalone driver if you are familiar with the Fortran interface.
